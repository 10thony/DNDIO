Player Characters (aka PCs), NPCs and Monsters will all need to be updated to support references to equipment.

currently there are items and this is a good foundation, the item object structure must be adapted to have modifiers that
determine how they affect the character/monster's ability score.
the item schema will also need to be updated to support a new optional column that represents the typeOfArmor (if this is null/empty its assumed the item is not armor).
items must also have a decay timer (durability) which wont be represented by a date but rather by a random max number (the more rare an item the longer the durability max cap can be)
durability gets generated based on the calculated (base durability base dur mapping *2) + randomlygeneratednumber(maxNumber by rarity see MaxDurMapping)

base dur mapping:
common 10
uncommon 12
rare 15
very rare 20
legendary 25
unique 30

Max Dur Mapping:
common 100
uncommon 125
rare 150
very rare 175
legendary 200
artifact 225 
unique 250

PCs, npcs, monsters, must have their schema updated to have multiple sets of items now, an inventory with a Capacity is calculated by the PCs,Npcs,monster's Strength attribute * 2 + randomNumber(strength attribute as the max)
a subset of that is their Equipment which includeds, headgear, armwear, chestwear, legwear, footwear. 


the modals for pcs npcs monsters must be updated to reflect the changes made to their schemas

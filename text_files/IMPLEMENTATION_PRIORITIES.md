## Technical Dependencies

### Required Infrastructure
- [ ] Convex subscription setup
- [ ] Real-time notification system
- [ ] Global state management
- [ ] Error handling framework

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] < 500ms response time for status updates
- [ ] > 99% real-time sync accuracy
- [ ] < 1% error rate for state operations
- [ ] > 90 Lighthouse score for mobile

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for all new functions
- [ ] Integration tests for real-time features
- [ ] End-to-end tests for user workflows
- [ ] Performance testing under load

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Real-time Complexity**: Start with simple subscriptions, add complexity gradually
2. **Performance Issues**: Monitor continuously, optimize early
3. **Mobile Compatibility**: Test on multiple devices from day one
4. **Data Consistency**: Implement robust conflict resolution

### Contingency Plans
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Offline mode with sync on reconnect
- **Graceful Degradation**: Core features work without real-time updates
- **Rollback Strategy**: Ability to revert to previous stable version
- **User Communication**: Clear messaging about feature availability

## Success Criteria

### Phase 4 Success Metrics

### Phase 5 Success Metrics
- [ ] User task completion rate > 95%
- [ ] Mobile performance score > 90
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] User satisfaction > 4.5/5

### Phase 6 Success Metrics
- [ ] Template usage adoption > 30%
- [ ] Bulk operations reduce manual work by 50%
- [ ] Analytics provide actionable insights
- [ ] Advanced features increase user engagement by 20%

# Phase 1 Implementation Summary - Campaign Join Request System

## Overview
Phase 1 focused on establishing the foundational database schema and API endpoints for the campaign join request system. This phase implemented the backend infrastructure needed to support user requests to join campaigns and the notification system.

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. Schema Updates (`convex/schema.ts`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added `joinRequests` table with the following fields:
  - `campaignId`: Reference to the campaign being requested
  - `requesterUserClerkId`: Clerk ID of the requesting user
  - `requesterUserId`: Internal user ID reference
  - `playerCharacterId`: Character the user wants to play
  - `status`: Union type for PENDING, APPROVED, DENIED
  - `denyReason`: Optional string for denial explanations
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp for request creation
  - `updatedAt`: Optional timestamp for status changes

- Added `notifications` table with the following fields:
  - `userClerkId`: Clerk ID of the notification recipient
  - `type`: Union type for JOIN_REQUEST, JOIN_APPROVED, JOIN_DENIED
  - `payload`: Flexible object for notification data
  - `isRead`: Boolean flag for read status
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp for notification creation

### 2. New API File (`convex/joinRequests.ts`)
**Functions Implemented:**

#### Core Join Request Functions:
- `createJoinRequest`: Creates new join requests with validation
- `getJoinRequestsByCampaign`: Retrieves requests for a specific campaign (DM/admin only)
- `getJoinRequestsByUser`: Retrieves user's own join requests
- `approveJoinRequest`: Approves requests and adds users to campaign
- `denyJoinRequest`: Denies requests with optional reason

#### Notification Functions:
- `getNotifications`: Retrieves user's notifications
- `markNotificationRead`: Marks individual notification as read
- `markAllNotificationsRead`: Marks all user notifications as read

## Key Features Implemented

### Authorization & Security
- **Role-based access control**: Only DMs, admins, and campaign creators can view/approve requests
- **Duplicate prevention**: Users cannot create multiple pending requests for the same campaign
- **Validation checks**: Ensures campaigns are public and users aren't already participants
- **User verification**: All operations require proper user authentication

### Business Logic
- **Request validation**: Checks campaign existence, public status, and user eligibility
- **Automatic participant management**: When approved, users are automatically added to campaign participant lists
- **Notification system**: Automatic notifications for DMs on new requests and users on approval/denial
- **Status tracking**: Complete audit trail of request status changes

### Data Integrity
- **Referential integrity**: All foreign key relationships properly maintained
- **Atomic operations**: Database operations are atomic to prevent partial updates
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error messages for various failure scenarios

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Design
- **Normalized structure**: Proper separation of concerns between requests and notifications
- **Indexed queries**: Efficient filtering by campaign, user, and status
- **Flexible payload**: Notifications use `any` type for extensible notification data

### API Patterns
- **Consistent with existing codebase**: Follows established patterns from `campaigns.ts`
- **Proper error handling**: Throws descriptive errors for various scenarios
- **Authorization checks**: Server-side validation for all sensitive operations
- **Real-time ready**: Queries structured for potential real-time updates

### Validation Rules
1. **Campaign must exist and be public**
2. **User cannot be already participating**
3. **User cannot be the DM of the campaign**
4. **No duplicate pending/approved requests**
5. **Only authorized users can approve/deny requests**
6. **Requests must be in PENDING status to be processed**

## Testing Considerations
- All functions include proper error handling and validation
- Authorization logic tested for various user roles
- Edge cases handled (duplicate requests, invalid campaigns, etc.)
- Database constraints ensure data consistency

## Next Phase Preparation
Phase 1 establishes the complete backend foundation needed for:
- Frontend join request modals
- DM approval interfaces
- Notification components
- Real-time updates

The API is designed to be easily consumed by React components and supports all the functionality outlined in the development plan.

## Files Ready for Phase 2
- Schema changes deployed and ready
- API endpoints tested and functional
- Authorization patterns established
- Error handling comprehensive

Phase 1 successfully implements all backend requirements and provides a solid foundation for the frontend implementation in subsequent phases.

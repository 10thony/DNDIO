**Changes:**
- Enhanced `getAllActiveInteractions()` query with proper filtering using `q.and()`

### 2. `src/components/InteractionDetail.tsx`
**New Imports:**
- Added `useUser` from Clerk for user authentication
- Added new mutations: `activateInteraction`, `setActiveInteraction`

**New State Variables:**
- `selectedCampaignId` - Tracks the selected campaign for activation
- Added `campaignSelection` to ModalType union

## Features Implemented

### 1. Status Display
- Visual status badges with color coding
- Status text formatting (underscores replaced with spaces)
- Dark mode support for all status elements

### 2. Status-Based Action Buttons
- **Activate Interaction**: Shows for interactions without campaign links
- **Join Live Interaction**: Shows for active interactions with campaign links
- **Mark as Completed**: Shows for pending interactions

### 3. Campaign Linking
- Modal interface for selecting campaigns
- Real-time campaign list from user's available campaigns
- Visual feedback for selected campaign
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 4. Navigation Integration
- Seamless navigation to live interaction dashboard
- Proper URL construction with campaign ID
- Back navigation preservation

## User Workflow

1. **View Interaction**: User views an inactive interaction
2. **Activate**: User clicks "Activate Interaction" button
3. **Select Campaign**: User selects a campaign from the modal
4. **Confirm**: User confirms activation
5. **Join Live**: User can now click "Join Live Interaction" to enter live mode

## Technical Details

### Database Operations
- Updates interaction with campaign ID and status
- Sets interaction as active for the selected campaign
- Maintains proper timestamps and audit trail

### Error Handling
- Validation for campaign selection
- Proper error messages for failed operations
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

### State Management
- Local state for modal management
- Campaign selection state
- Real-time updates through Convex queries

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Status badges display correctly for all status types
- [ ] Action buttons appear based on interaction status
- [ ] Campaign selection modal opens and functions
- [ ] Activation process completes successfully
- [ ] Navigation to live interaction works
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Dark mode styling works correctly

### Edge Cases
- User with no campaigns
- Network failures during activation
- Invalid campaign IDs
- Concurrent access to same interaction

## Next Steps

This milestone provides the foundation for:
- Milestone 2: Live Interaction List Page
- Milestone 3: Enhanced Campaign Integration
- Milestone 4: State Synchronization

The status management system is now ready for integration with the live interaction dashboard and real-time updates.

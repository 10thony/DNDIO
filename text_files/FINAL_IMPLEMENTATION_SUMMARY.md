joinRequests: {
  campaignId: Id<"campaigns">
  requesterUserClerkId: string
  requesterUserId: Id<"users">
  playerCharacterId: Id<"playerCharacters">
  status: "PENDING" | "APPROVED" | "DENIED"
  denyReason?: string
  createdAt: number
  updatedAt?: number
}

// Notifications Table
notifications: {
  userClerkId: string
  type: "JOIN_REQUEST" | "JOIN_APPROVED" | "JOIN_DENIED"
  payload: any
  isRead: boolean
  createdAt: number
}
```

- `denyJoinRequest`: Deny with optional reason
- `getNotifications`: Get user's notifications
- `markNotificationRead`: Mark individual as read
- `markAllNotificationsRead`: Mark all as read

### Component Architecture
- **Functional Components**: Modern React with hooks
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
- **State Management**: Local state with Convex real-time queries

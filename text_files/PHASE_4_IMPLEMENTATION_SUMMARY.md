## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
- **Functional Components**: Modern React with hooks
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interfaces
- **State Management**: Local state for UI interactions
- **Props Pattern**: Clean prop passing with callbacks

### Data Flow
1. **Component mounts** → Fetches user notifications
2. **Real-time updates** → Notification count updates automatically
3. **User clicks icon** → Opens notification panel
4. **User clicks notification** → Marks as read and navigates
5. **User clicks mark all read** → Updates all notifications

### API Integration
- **Convex Queries**: `getNotifications` for real-time data
- **Convex Mutations**: `markNotificationRead`, `markAllNotificationsRead`
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic UI updates when data changes

### UI/UX Patterns
- **Dropdown Design**: Standard notification panel pattern
- **Badge System**: Visual indicator for unread items
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Panel opens on demand
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## User Interface Elements

### Notification Icon
- **Bell Icon**: Universal notification symbol
- **Unread Badge**: Red badge with count and pulse animation
- **Hover Effects**: Visual feedback on interaction
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels

### Notification Panel
- **Header**: Title, mark all read button, close button
- **Content Area**: Scrollable list of notifications
- **Grouping**: Unread and read sections
- **Empty State**: Clear messaging when no notifications

### Notification Items
- **Icon**: Type-specific emoji icons
- **Content**: Title, message, and timestamp
- **Visual States**: Different styling for unread/read

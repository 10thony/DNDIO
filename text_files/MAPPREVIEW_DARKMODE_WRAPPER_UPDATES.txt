MapPreview Dark Mode Wrapper Updates
===================================

The following components were updated to ensure the wrapper around MapPreview uses a dark mode aware background (bg-white dark:bg-gray-800) for visual consistency:

1. src/components/maps/MapsList.tsx
   - Updated the wrapper div around MapPreview in each map card to:
     `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded p-2 w-full max-w-full`

2. src/components/LocationDetails.tsx
   - Updated the wrapper div around MapPreview in the map section to:
     `flex justify-center items-center p-4 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded`

3. src/components/LocationForm.tsx
   - Updated the wrapper div around MapPreview in the map preview section to:
     `border rounded-md p-4 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800`

4. src/components/maps/MapCreator.tsx
   - Updated the preview wrapper in create mode to:
     `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg w-full max-w-full overflow-auto flex justify-center`
   - Updated the preview wrapper in edit mode to:
     `overflow-auto border rounded-lg bg-white dark:bg-gray-800`

All wrappers now provide a consistent background in both light and dark mode for the MapPreview component.

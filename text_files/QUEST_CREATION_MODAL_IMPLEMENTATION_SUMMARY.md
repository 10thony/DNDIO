## Overview
Successfully implemented a QuestCreationModal component that integrates seamlessly with the campaign creation form, allowing users to create quests directly within the campaign creation process.

- ✅ Responsive design with proper scrolling for large forms
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ Loading states during submission
